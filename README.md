In this data science project we are going to start a very basic project i.e:  credit card fraud detection (which is a classification problem wheather a transaction is fraud(1) or notfraud(0) ) , where we first defined our goal then from the various processes like  importing python packages, data retrieval , preperation , cleaning , integrating the data , transformation , EDA(exploratory data analysis) , training and testing data , and data modelling        We achieve some various machine learning models with very good accuracy score , make the accuracy score more interactive by listing them and selecting the good model for use , and and and    i have also created confusion matrix(shows performance of a classification problem)
